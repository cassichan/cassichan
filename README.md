Hi 👋 My name is Cassandra Curcio
=================================

Aspiring software developer
---------------------------

I had been learning to code slowly at home while working full-time as a Registered Nurse. I finally took some major steps to transition careers. I am currently enrolled in a full-stack software development boot camp. I've dabbled a bit with HTML and CSS, but am currently enjoying Javscript the most! Aside from coding, I love to spend time with my 2 cats, appreciate nature, game, and do food-related activities (eat, cook, bake, read about food/watch cooking shows, you name it)!
